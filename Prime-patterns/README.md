# Prime-patterns
Finding patterns in prime by arranging composite and primes in a matrix with different notation

A prime spiral
A prime spiral is like the spiral in the previous assignment, but instead of printing each
integer value in the spiral, print the # (hash) character if the value is prime and the
. (dot) character if it isnâ€™t. Depending on the size of the spiral and the starting value,
patterns will emerge among the primes in the form of diagonal streaks.

This would result in interesting patterns of primes.
